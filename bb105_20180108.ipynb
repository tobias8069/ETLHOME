       " 'content': 'Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of\\xa0Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.The crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting, managing risk and keeping sane.Howard Marks describes two ways to profit from markets: (1) Hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall, and (2) cycle adjustment, or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fall.Most people ignore the second part. Yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it. Similar to the broader economy, we have both short and long-term cycles. Short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows, investor composition and market sentiment. Long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentals.The past few months in contextOver the last few months, the market has been driven by new capital entering the space and a psychological acceptance of bitcoin. The capital — both retail and institutional (i.e., new crypto hedge funds) — entered initially through the most liquid crypto assets and fiat currency onramps.Bitcoin, being the most liquid fiat onramp, has performed well. It was also the first asset many investors became comfortable with during that time.From July 1st to Dec. 10th, bitcoin dominance (or its percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies was increasing outside of bitcoin. BTC\\'s price increased from $2,492 to almost $20,000.I\\'ll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals, but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin. New capital had a bias for bitcoin because it was the easiest to understand, custody and purchase.The short-term cycle moved in BTC\\'s favor.The short-term crypto cycle in actionMoving toward December, the market started to become more and more dominated by retail and – let\\'s be honest – less crypto-educated capital. Coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon. From June to October, Coinbase signups were relatively constant at\\xa0 about30,000 per day.However, starting in early November, this number started to increase dramatically, exceeding 100,000 on some days.Initially, this capital continued to pour into bitcoin, putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of BTC.BTC was going to $100,000, and by the time CNBC debuted its coveted \"BTC Ticker,\" the pendulum had swung too far in BTC\\'s direction.Larger investors started to take profits, bitcoin began to falter. It was time to find the next new shiny object…As capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets, we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next. Starting in early December, a new cycle began and the \"cheaper\" Coinbase assets stole the show.Capital that initially entered the crypto markets through BTC was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve. In other words, it was time to play with house money.The newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol\\'s marketing pitch. These were not cypherpunks.BTC is archaic and overpriced to these investors. There is no EEA of bitcoin. No marketing team is pushing it. Why buy a $17,000 digital gold when you could buy a $100, faster alternative? In the first three weeks of December alone, litecoin increased 3.7x from $100 to $371 while BTC continued to lose ground.LTC, too, would have a fall from grace when longer-term LTC holders began to sell (ahem Charlie) and returns started to stagnate. These restless investors moved on once again with more house money to play with. Their attention moved from the roulette table that is Coinbase to the craps table that is Bittrex, Poloniex and Binance. As a result, signups on those exchanges skyrocketed, and Bittrex even had to close new user accounts.\"Holy shit, even cheaper versions of BTC.\" Their marketing budgets lured them in with the siren call of lambos.It seems ridiculous to say, but the cheaper the asset, the greater the chance of a return. And when I said cheap, I\\'m not referring to a fundamental measure of value like a value investor would (P/BV, P/E, etc). I\\'m referring to its price.A chart of returns over the past seven days paints this picture. There\\'s a direct negative correlation between the\\xa0price of the token and return. It\\'s scary, but it\\'s unfortunately true.TRX, XRP, XLM, ADA, you name it. \"Bitcoin 3.0.\" Faster, cheaper and more upside. Right? It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC retreated 40% and overall dominance fell from 65% down to 37% this week. The fire was already smoldering.New retail investors were the gasoline. Preston Byrne said it best – cryptocurrencies have become the worlds largest penny stock casino.How to weather the shitcoin stormInvestors trying to find fundamental value are ripping their eyes out. XRP, with legitimately zero fundamental usage (see below), just passed BTC in diluted market cap.\\nOver the last day I’ve asked several people close to banks if banks are indeed planning to begin using Ripple’s token, XRP, in a serious way, which is what investors seem to assume when they buy in at the current XRP prices. This is a sampling of what I heard back: pic.twitter.com/zbfMqg4TpD\\n— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) January 5, 2018IOTA has proven cryptographic flaws. What the hell is TRON? RaiBlocks went from a market cap of $30 million to $4 billion in a week. What. The. Fuck.Meanwhile, assets with real usage, actual code and strong development communities, like monero for example, have not moved. Are investors supposed to recognize the reality of the situation that, for the current market regime, fundamental protocol strength — adoption, code quality, tech talent, etc. — means less than the price of the asset and marketing budget.Should you go all-in on coins less than $1? Or do you stick to your guns, find value and weather the shitcoin storm?The answer comes down to understanding where we are the cryptocurrency cycle.Where we are – and how to profitThe answer to investing is rarely black and white. It’s not \"get in\" or \"get out.\" It\\'s usually somewhere in the middle.When people are increasingly willing to take risk and fear of missing out (FOMO) is prevailing over any sense of security and analytical discipline, that\\'s the time to be worried. When the fundamentally weakest assets are rallying the most and people are proclaiming BTC is dead, we\\'re starting to near the end of a short-term, altcoin-dominated cycle.The problem is that investors tend to think of themselves as analytical, disciplined and contrarian, but the fact of the matter is that most tend to magnify cyclical moves. They cannot stomach the possibility they may miss out on gains.That is why predicting the exact top and bottom is so challenging. But doing so with exact precision is not necessary…\\nDoes anyone still talk about Bitcoin?\\n— Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 5, 2018Howard Marks describes the strategy well:\"No one can ascertain when we’re at the exact top or bottom, a key to successful investing lies in selling – or lightening up – when we’re closer to the top, and buying\\u200a—\\u200aor, hopefully, loading up\\u200a—\\u200awhen we’re closer to the bottom.\"Profiting from the short-term market cycles is not predicated on owning 0 bitcoin at peak alt and 0 alts at peak BTC. The key is that when investor euphoria is widespread, we should lighten up on those assets which are expensive and be more aggressive with those that are cheap. The time to be overweight alts is at the beginning and middle of the altcoin cycle. Not towards the end. And the same generally holds true for bitcoin.It\\'s about calibrating and balancing your allocation of capital in accordance with the current cycle and how aggressive or defensive you want to be.Meanwhile, amid the small-cap and altcoin euphoria, we\\'re on the precipice of a major entrance of institutional capital to the space and the one place it is going is BTC. Family offices, large hedge funds and endowments will not be investing in Bcash. A BTC ETF will launch sooner than people think. A TRON one will not.To profit from these cycles, you need to first understand where we stand in it and then be able to act counter to it at the peaks and troughs. It\\'s not easy. The only reason it\\'s profitable is that because it\\'s so hard. At first, you\\'re bound to lose money as the cycle continues in its march to irrationality. But the cycle will always turn, and in crypto, we know it won\\'t be long until it does.Those with large altcoin positions should be worried. When the cycle reaches its peak and begins to turn, smaller-cap, illiquid tokens will fall as fast as they\\'ve gone up. Liquidity will dry up fast and you will not be able to sell anywhere close to the quoted price.The market in altcoin terms is getting expensive and in BTC terms it\\'s getting cheaper. It\\'s time to start using altcoin gains to build up core, fundamentally strong positions.A alk down memory laneI\\'m not making this up. We\\'ve seen it happen before.This period is eerily similar to March 2017. \"Bitcoin 2.0,\" ethereum, had recently launched on Coinbase, the EEA was getting cemented and a slew of conferences were created to promote etheruem. Why invest in digital gold when you could own a world computer?For three months, ETH dramatically increased in price as new retail investors poured into the space and quit their jobs to day trade after massive gains. ETH increased in price from $7 in December of 2016 to $391 by June of 2017. BTC dominance fell from 86% to 40%. We were on the precipice of \"the flippening,\" after which many thought BTC would subsequently fall to zero.Until the music stopped. Investors were tapped out. ICOs slowed down and ETH started having scaling issues just as the price got ahead of itself. Institutional capital began to enter BTC. The BTC dominance cycle began to revert.Illiquid altcoins, some of the same ones the new retail investors have made their money from, fell dramatically. XVG fell from a peak of $0.006 down to $0.002, a 67% decline. XRP fell from $0.31 to $0.15, a 50% decline.This year isn’t the first time it\\'s happened. Investors have been lured out of bitcoin into altcoins since the first ones launched.Since 2013, we’ve been seeing BTC dominance fall, only to regain most of the lost ground shortly thereafter. This cycle,\\xa0too, will revert.What causes each cycle?Each aforementioned BTC cycle has a common thread: The investor base, partially driven by new capital, becomes enamored by an alternative asset or market narrative.The cycle is usually triggered by a legitimate change in fundamentals. And then, subsequently, it\\'s taken to the extreme by investor behavior. Earlier in 2017, it was smart contract functionality and ICOs. Now, as BTC fees creep up and ETH is facing scaling issues, most of the coins that have increased in price are aiming to be cheaper, faster or more scalable.What we\\'re actually seeing is a mini-Gartner hype cycle play out around a new market theme or narrative.New technology captures investor attention. Emotional influences cause investors to follow the herd and fear of missing out predominates. The cycle gets taken to its extreme until it can go no further.\\nAt one Point in the 1989 Japanese real estate bubble, the Imperial Palace in Japan was said to be worth more than the entire state of California,, things that don\\'t make sense don\\'t last....be careful out there\\n— Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) January 4, 2018How to prepare for the next altcoin cycleIt goes without saying, but the current market regime is not fundamentally driven whatsoever, but is instead driven by narrative and investor sentiment.The market is a Keynesian beauty contest. It\\'s crucial to practice second-level thinking— the question isn\\'t just why a protocol is interesting, but why and when\\xa0the market\\xa0will find it interesting.The most profitable trades come from synthesizing views on the macro liquidity cycle, narrative and capital flows with micro-analysis into the crypto-economic tradeoffs and qualities of each protocol.Towards the end of each short-term cycle, instead of doubling down on what\\'s been working — i.e. doubling down on altcoins right now — prepare for the turn of the next.When in a BTC cycle, the question to ask is: what narrative will be the crux of the next Gartner hype cycle? Where will the capital flow when the BTC cycle peaks, and what will be the catalyst?Fundamentally analyze each protocol and determine which will benefit most from a shift in narrative. Do your diligence. Make sure the code and underlying infrastructure is sound and protect your capital.When you inevitably find yourself thinking that BTC or [INSERT PROTOCOL HERE] can\\'t be stopped, remember that we\\'ve been evolutionarily programmed to think pro-cyclically. It will be stopped.

       "[{'author': 'Brendan Bernstein',\n",
       "  'content': 'Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of\\xa0Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.The crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting, managing risk and keeping sane.Howard Marks describes two ways to profit from markets: (1) Hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall, and (2) cycle adjustment, or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fall.Most people ignore the second part. Yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it. Similar to the broader economy, we have both short and long-term cycles. Short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows, investor composition and market sentiment. Long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentals.The past few months in contextOver the last few months, the market has been driven by new capital entering the space and a psychological acceptance of bitcoin. The capital — both retail and institutional (i.e., new crypto hedge funds) — entered initially through the most liquid crypto assets and fiat currency onramps.Bitcoin, being the most liquid fiat onramp, has performed well. It was also the first asset many investors became comfortable with during that time.From July 1st to Dec. 10th, bitcoin dominance (or its percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies was increasing outside of bitcoin. BTC\\'s price increased from $2,492 to almost $20,000.I\\'ll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals, but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin. New capital had a bias for bitcoin because it was the easiest to understand, custody and purchase.The short-term cycle moved in BTC\\'s favor.The short-term crypto cycle in actionMoving toward December, the market started to become more and more dominated by retail and – let\\'s be honest – less crypto-educated capital. Coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon. From June to October, Coinbase signups were relatively constant at\\xa0 about30,000 per day.However, starting in early November, this number started to increase dramatically, exceeding 100,000 on some days.Initially, this capital continued to pour into bitcoin, putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of BTC.BTC was going to $100,000, and by the time CNBC debuted its coveted \"BTC Ticker,\" the pendulum had swung too far in BTC\\'s direction.Larger investors started to take profits, bitcoin began to falter. It was time to find the next new shiny object…As capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets, we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next. Starting in early December, a new cycle began and the \"cheaper\" Coinbase assets stole the show.Capital that initially entered the crypto markets through BTC was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve. In other words, it was time to play with house money.The newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol\\'s marketing pitch. These were not cypherpunks.BTC is archaic and overpriced to these investors. There is no EEA of bitcoin. No marketing team is pushing it. Why buy a $17,000 digital gold when you could buy a $100, faster alternative? In the first three weeks of December alone, litecoin increased 3.7x from $100 to $371 while BTC continued to lose ground.LTC, too, would have a fall from grace when longer-term LTC holders began to sell (ahem Charlie) and returns started to stagnate. These restless investors moved on once again with more house money to play with. Their attention moved from the roulette table that is Coinbase to the craps table that is Bittrex, Poloniex and Binance. As a result, signups on those exchanges skyrocketed, and Bittrex even had to close new user accounts.\"Holy shit, even cheaper versions of BTC.\" Their marketing budgets lured them in with the siren call of lambos.It seems ridiculous to say, but the cheaper the asset, the greater the chance of a return. And when I said cheap, I\\'m not referring to a fundamental measure of value like a value investor would (P/BV, P/E, etc). I\\'m referring to its price.A chart of returns over the past seven days paints this picture. There\\'s a direct negative correlation between the\\xa0price of the token and return. It\\'s scary, but it\\'s unfortunately true.TRX, XRP, XLM, ADA, you name it. \"Bitcoin 3.0.\" Faster, cheaper and more upside. Right? It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC retreated 40% and overall dominance fell from 65% down to 37% this week. The fire was already smoldering.New retail investors were the gasoline. Preston Byrne said it best – cryptocurrencies have become the worlds largest penny stock casino.How to weather the shitcoin stormInvestors trying to find fundamental value are ripping their eyes out. XRP, with legitimately zero fundamental usage (see below), just passed BTC in diluted market cap.\\nOver the last day I’ve asked several people close to banks if banks are indeed planning to begin using Ripple’s token, XRP, in a serious way, which is what investors seem to assume when they buy in at the current XRP prices. This is a sampling of what I heard back: pic.twitter.com/zbfMqg4TpD\\n— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) January 5, 2018IOTA has proven cryptographic flaws. What the hell is TRON? RaiBlocks went from a market cap of $30 million to $4 billion in a week. What. The. Fuck.Meanwhile, assets with real usage, actual code and strong development communities, like monero for example, have not moved. Are investors supposed to recognize the reality of the situation that, for the current market regime, fundamental protocol strength — adoption, code quality, tech talent, etc. — means less than the price of the asset and marketing budget.Should you go all-in on coins less than $1? Or do you stick to your guns, find value and weather the shitcoin storm?The answer comes down to understanding where we are the cryptocurrency cycle.Where we are – and how to profitThe answer to investing is rarely black and white. It’s not \"get in\" or \"get out.\" It\\'s usually somewhere in the middle.When people are increasingly willing to take risk and fear of missing out (FOMO) is prevailing over any sense of security and analytical discipline, that\\'s the time to be worried. When the fundamentally weakest assets are rallying the most and people are proclaiming BTC is dead, we\\'re starting to near the end of a short-term, altcoin-dominated cycle.The problem is that investors tend to think of themselves as analytical, disciplined and contrarian, but the fact of the matter is that most tend to magnify cyclical moves. They cannot stomach the possibility they may miss out on gains.That is why predicting the exact top and bottom is so challenging. But doing so with exact precision is not necessary…\\nDoes anyone still talk about Bitcoin?\\n— Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 5, 2018Howard Marks describes the strategy well:\"No one can ascertain when we’re at the exact top or bottom, a key to successful investing lies in selling – or lightening up – when we’re closer to the top, and buying\\u200a—\\u200aor, hopefully, loading up\\u200a—\\u200awhen we’re closer to the bottom.\"Profiting from the short-term market cycles is not predicated on owning 0 bitcoin at peak alt and 0 alts at peak BTC. The key is that when investor euphoria is widespread, we should lighten up on those assets which are expensive and be more aggressive with those that are cheap. The time to be overweight alts is at the beginning and middle of the altcoin cycle. Not towards the end. And the same generally holds true for bitcoin.It\\'s about calibrating and balancing your allocation of capital in accordance with the current cycle and how aggressive or defensive you want to be.Meanwhile, amid the small-cap and altcoin euphoria, we\\'re on the precipice of a major entrance of institutional capital to the space and the one place it is going is BTC. Family offices, large hedge funds and endowments will not be investing in Bcash. A BTC ETF will launch sooner than people think. A TRON one will not.To profit from these cycles, you need to first understand where we stand in it and then be able to act counter to it at the peaks and troughs. It\\'s not easy. The only reason it\\'s profitable is that because it\\'s so hard. At first, you\\'re bound to lose money as the cycle continues in its march to irrationality. But the cycle will always turn, and in crypto, we know it won\\'t be long until it does.Those with large altcoin positions should be worried. When the cycle reaches its peak and begins to turn, smaller-cap, illiquid tokens will fall as fast as they\\'ve gone up. Liquidity will dry up fast and you will not be able to sell anywhere close to the quoted price.The market in altcoin terms is getting expensive and in BTC terms it\\'s getting cheaper. It\\'s time to start using altcoin gains to build up core, fundamentally strong positions.A alk down memory laneI\\'m not making this up. We\\'ve seen it happen before.This period is eerily similar to March 2017. \"Bitcoin 2.0,\" ethereum, had recently launched on Coinbase, the EEA was getting cemented and a slew of conferences were created to promote etheruem. Why invest in digital gold when you could own a world computer?For three months, ETH dramatically increased in price as new retail investors poured into the space and quit their jobs to day trade after massive gains. ETH increased in price from $7 in December of 2016 to $391 by June of 2017. BTC dominance fell from 86% to 40%. We were on the precipice of \"the flippening,\" after which many thought BTC would subsequently fall to zero.Until the music stopped. Investors were tapped out. ICOs slowed down and ETH started having scaling issues just as the price got ahead of itself. Institutional capital began to enter BTC. The BTC dominance cycle began to revert.Illiquid altcoins, some of the same ones the new retail investors have made their money from, fell dramatically. XVG fell from a peak of $0.006 down to $0.002, a 67% decline. XRP fell from $0.31 to $0.15, a 50% decline.This year isn’t the first time it\\'s happened. Investors have been lured out of bitcoin into altcoins since the first ones launched.Since 2013, we’ve been seeing BTC dominance fall, only to regain most of the lost ground shortly thereafter. This cycle,\\xa0too, will revert.What causes each cycle?Each aforementioned BTC cycle has a common thread: The investor base, partially driven by new capital, becomes enamored by an alternative asset or market narrative.The cycle is usually triggered by a legitimate change in fundamentals. And then, subsequently, it\\'s taken to the extreme by investor behavior. Earlier in 2017, it was smart contract functionality and ICOs. Now, as BTC fees creep up and ETH is facing scaling issues, most of the coins that have increased in price are aiming to be cheaper, faster or more scalable.What we\\'re actually seeing is a mini-Gartner hype cycle play out around a new market theme or narrative.New technology captures investor attention. Emotional influences cause investors to follow the herd and fear of missing out predominates. The cycle gets taken to its extreme until it can go no further.\\nAt one Point in the 1989 Japanese real estate bubble, the Imperial Palace in Japan was said to be worth more than the entire state of California,, things that don\\'t make sense don\\'t last....be careful out there\\n— Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) January 4, 2018How to prepare for the next altcoin cycleIt goes without saying, but the current market regime is not fundamentally driven whatsoever, but is instead driven by narrative and investor sentiment.The market is a Keynesian beauty contest. It\\'s crucial to practice second-level thinking— the question isn\\'t just why a protocol is interesting, but why and when\\xa0the market\\xa0will find it interesting.The most profitable trades come from synthesizing views on the macro liquidity cycle, narrative and capital flows with micro-analysis into the crypto-economic tradeoffs and qualities of each protocol.Towards the end of each short-term cycle, instead of doubling down on what\\'s been working — i.e. doubling down on altcoins right now — prepare for the turn of the next.When in a BTC cycle, the question to ask is: what narrative will be the crux of the next Gartner hype cycle? Where will the capital flow when the BTC cycle peaks, and what will be the catalyst?Fundamentally analyze each protocol and determine which will benefit most from a shift in narrative. Do your diligence.

       "  'content': 'There\\'s never enough eyes out there looking for threats against internet users.Take the recently disclosed\\xa0Specter and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities, which showed how threats can linger for years undetected. Though as much as such giant engineering failures get attention, each of us is more likely to be hit by smaller threats, such as an email trick or an attachment loaded with malicious links.But for\\xa0Swarm Technologies, there is a lack of incentives for security experts to look as widely as they could.Spinning out of the security firm Narf Industries, which recently completed a blockchain identity management project for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\\xa0Swarm Technologies believes a crypto token could be a way to close gaps in software more quickly. As such, on Sunday night, the company announced that it will be running an initial coin offering (ICO) for the purpose of enlisting security researchers across the globe in creating a safer internet. Proceeds raised during the $50 million token sale, which starts February 6, will initially go to building out a platform called PolySwarm, the hub where Swarm hopes security researchers will come together to work on what it calls \"micro-engines,\" specialized software built to scan documents, files and websites that might hide vulnerabilities.It\\'s becoming a common application of blockchains, this use of a limited data set to galvanize distributed communities toward goals.\\xa0According to Bassi, Augur, the ethereum prediction market, was of particular inspiration, but while Augur harnesses the wisdom of the crowd to predict outcomes, PolySwarm wants only to incentivize experts.But to understand the company\\'s mission, it\\'s helpful to understand how threat detection works today, where enterprise companies do scans to check for threats when web users do anything from click on a URL to open an email.To do this more effectively, Swarm is looking to enlist enterprise IT teams and antivirus software companies that spot new files, new software, new documents that need to be scanned, to farm out those scans to a distributed network of researchers. Those researchers will build machines to do specific scans, and each time they do Swarm will reward the machines by sending them the token.And in Bassi\\'s mind, this use case will flip cryptocurrency’s role as it relates to security – from paying the ransom on encryption attacks to one that makes developing solutions for more niche areas of the internet viable.Bassi told CoinDesk:\"We’re basically trying to re-invent threat intelligence.\"Security nectarThreat intelligence with added economics, is another way to put it.Swarm\\'s token, or \"nectar,\" will have a finite supply, 70 percent of which will be sold during the ICO. The company itself will keep 15 percent of the tokens, and the other 15 percent will be used to grow the network, including strategic allocations to potential security industry partners.The company is capping the sale at $50 million, with a $5 million pre-sale. Down the road, Swarm envisions new business lines in assurance services, such as verification of security experts, analysis and insurance.As an ERC-20 token riding on the ethereum blockchain, Bassi said smart contracts are at the core of what will make the offering succeed. The nectar tokens will be used to make all the payments on the platform, but those payments don\\'t just flow from Swarm to the researchers. The system also requires micro-engines to stake an amount of nectar tokens on its assessment of the digital products it\\'s scanning.\"The tokens they have to put into their assertion also indicates their confidence in that assertion,\" Bassi told CoinDesk.Every micro-engine (and in turn the researcher who built it) that makes the correct assessment gets a share of the fee paid for the scan, plus a share of any nectar that was staked by micro-engines that assessed the digital product incorrectly.And according to Bassi, this mechanism of shared rewards incentivizes researchers to find niche areas to scan, where many other researchers might not be looking.This is particularly novel in that today\\'s anti-virus company structures incentivize chasing threats against the most widely used software, in an effort to attract the largest possible client base.He told CoinDesk:\"It provides more incentives to cover the minority populations that are getting hit hard with this stuff.\"And yet, Swarm isn\\'t out to totally disrupt the incumbents, such as Norton and McAfee, in the space. Instead, Bassi said, those companies could serve as what PolySwarm calls \"ambassadors,\" actually managing the relationship with consumers while PolySwarm enables them to guard against more threat surface.Blockchain criticsYet, for some, adding a blockchain to this industry isn\\'t going to solve the problems.According to Jessy Irwin, a security consultant and an alum of AgileBits, the developer of one of the leading password managers 1Password: \"I don\\'t see a clear or realistic incentive to adding a blockchain to this particular problem.\"Irwin continued, arguing that threat intelligence is already distributed and collaborative.\"Malware hunters and researchers are very much widely distributed in many different kinds of organizations,\" she said. \"The people working on these issues are highly collaborative with one another while they are working on specific projects and campaigns.\"Yet, while Irwin is skeptical, other well-known security researchers seem to see value in the platform. Swarm\\'s advisers on the project include Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a security firm that’s a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and Mark Tonnesen, whose done executive stints at Cisco and McAfee.According to Bassi, \"A token is critical to that, because up until a few years ago, we didn’t have a way to move rewards across borders in sub-cent amounts without involving the global banking infrastructure.\"As Guido told CoinDesk, \"They\\'re security engineers who found a new way to solve an old problem with blockchain technology. If another tool fit they job, then that\\'s what they would be using.\"But Bassi\\'s convinced that smart contracts are the right tool to get more eyes on threats:\"It encourages the use of a utility token for a service that’s deeply needed.\"Safety deposit boxes via Shutterstock\\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

       "  'content': 'Bradley Miles and Sid Kalla are the co-founders of Turing Group, an incubation and advisory firm focused on token protocol design and the ICO sales process.The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk\\'s 2017 in Review.If 2017 has taught us anything, it\\'s that there\\'s no shortage of tokens. Yet, this strength in numbers has brought pitfalls for new investors and analysts, many of whom seem to be having a hard time trying to understand or value their options. Why is that?\\xa0After all, Wall Street has been valuing other asset classes like stocks and bonds for over a century, and it has a fairly sophisticated models to value derivatives.One of the primary reasons is that token behaviors can be vastly different among projects.This is quite unlike the behavior or some traditional assets, such as stocks, which have very well defined value characteristics (dividends and price appreciation, arising out of expectations of future cash flows generated by a firm). In contrast, the value characteristics of crypto assets are very hard to define, let alone standardize for a valuation framework.Sharing the wealthThe good thing though is we can witness, in real time, great economic experiments, even if most of them fail.Even small choices in designing the right token can lead to differences in how the ecosystem distributes the value it creates. There is no universally right token design, only lessons learned and best practices to be gleaned.This flexibility is a double-edged sword – there are unprecedented possibilities when it comes to designing the crypto-economic characteristics of protocols, but it\\'s also easy to mess up. This new asset class is going to be unlike anything we’ve seen before, and we’ll need our own unique set of tools and mental models to get things right.After the speculative dust settles, crypto assets need to justify their valuation. The value that accrues to a token, however, isn’t trivial to identify or define. It is possible to create an immensely successful platform or protocol enabled by a token, where the value accrues to the users instead of the token holders.One such example is the \"utility token,\" which we\\'re beginning to understand\\xa0could support a huge economy with only a very small monetary base, if the\\xa0velocity of money is high. In this way, entrepreneurs designing the next generation of crypto protocols need to realize that the role of the token is not just in creating value but also distributing that value.One for allAs investors become more sophisticated and begin to grasp the underlying fundamentals of value creation in the ecosystem, they will naturally gravitate toward the protocols where reasonable value accrues to the token holders. The success of the protocol or the company building the protocol isn’t necessarily a measure of the success of the token.Investors doing their due diligence need to understand the whole spectrum of token characteristics, from the token’s monetary policy to how the token facilitates interaction among the users. Add in the technical complexities of a lot of these projects, and you begin to get an idea of how early we are in this space.Ultimately, the role of the crypto token in the protocol is essential to get right, but it isn’t a sufficient condition.The token needs to do several things, and do them all right. It needs to incentivize the right economic behavior from the participants. It needs to enable the right modes of interaction among the stakeholders, including the users, investors and the development team. It needs to be able to build network effects and grow the ecosystem without hampering the incentives of existing stakeholders.It needs to ensure that value is generated on the platform, and that value is distributed among the different stakeholders fairly in order to sustain the ecosystem for the long run.Still have questions about tokens and ICOs?\\xa0Share your thoughts on the ecosystem\\'s outlook.

       "  'content': 'Chris Brookins is the founder of Pugilist Ventures, a blockchain and fintech focused VC firm.The author invests in cryptocurrencies and has a position in XRP.It\\'s no secret the crypto space is in a speculative \"frothy\" frenzy currently.Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important. Speculators are trading on emotion and greed, not fundamentals. Such is arguably the case with XRP, the native token that powers Ripple\\'s RippleNet ledger. Over the last month, it has blown up by almost 1,400 percent, and it\\'s showing no signs of slowing.\\xa0Amidst this short-term frenzy, however, there is also opportunity for long-term analysis.When we made a trading recommendation on XRP to our investor network last month, we stated that despite XRP’s long-term hurdles, its price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike.At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25\\u200a—\\u200a$0.30.We did not forecast a specific price target given we don’t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming. We thought Ripple had great company fundamentals and that XRP’s speculative investment potential was ripe for high risk and high reward.Short-term analysisLooking ahead, Pugilist Ventures maintains both its speculative fundamental evaluation and its positive short-term trading view for XRP; simultaneously.While Ripple may be overbought, that doesn\\'t mean the market won\\'t keep buying. In short, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long-term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros.The fundamentals in the case of XRP are basically its long-term probability of becoming a quasi-reserve currency (QRC) for financial institutions. (We say \"quasi\" because we do not believe central banks will ever fully relinquish their local currencies without a fight.)The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas:\\nLiquidity and market makers\\nInstitutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheet\\nOn-boarding financial institutions onto its\\xa0xCurrent\\xa0and\\xa0xRapid\\xa0products in both exotic and non-exotic corridors.\\nReflexivity for XRPBy simple definition, Reflexivity is a three-part process whereby an asset’s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset’s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation.Rinse and repeat.Reflexive price appreciation may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap in 2018.This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple onboard more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP’s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status.XRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion.However, this speculation may actually increase the long-term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate.All of which provide fuel to Ripple’s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP.Disclosure:\\xa0CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Ferris wheel image via Shutterstock\\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

       "  'content': 'Ian Simpson is head of marketing and communications at Lakeside Partners, an early-stage investment firm in Zug, Switzerland.The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk\\'s 2017 in Review.Without a shadow of a doubt, this past year has been huge for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology. Whatever the future may hold for Satoshi\\'s brainchild and all that it has given birth to, 2017 will forever hold a singular position on the timeline of events in the crypto world. But as a new year approaches, the urge to get caught up in all that has happened over the past 12 months could prevent us from considering what 2017 did not bring – and why.Admittedly, it is hard not to be mesmerized by the numbers: the more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies, the $700-plus billion market cap they have produced or the eye-popping ICO raises of Tezos, Filecoin, Bancor and others – oh yes, and the gut-wrenching ride of bitcoin’s price as it climbed over $20 000 – and fell back down.And yet, it is worthwhile taking a step back and considering what is still missing and what exactly this might mean for the year that is almost upon us.1. We did not see mass adoption of blockchain for enterpriseWhile there has been plenty of talk about blockchain patents (Mastercard is one example) from big-name companies along with a surge in sign-ups to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, 2017 did not bring a whole-hearted embracing of crypto by established players across various industry verticals.Some will point to concrete financial and technology implementation factors to explain this – \"How can you invest in something that\\'s still so immature?\" and \"If it can’t scale how can we depend on it?\" – and certainly those may be valid points.Education (its lack and its acquisition) also plays a role. On the one hand, many executives still do not grasp how it actually works and yet still want to dabble in the space, if only to use the hype for marketing purposes.On the flip side, the more informed decision-makers in large corporations become, the more they realize how much the blockchain world challenges the very core of current systems and paradigms. For many, this knowledge makes them pull back and refuse to \"take the leap.\"I also suspect that – perhaps subconsciously – the hype surrounding ICO funding also served as a reactionary force, ironically as the very buzz that put bitcoin and blockchain on the lips of thousands also made many fear its disruptive force.If the wave of token sales slows in 2018 and regulatory uncertainty clears up, this may change, and arguably it must change if cryptocurrencies and token economics are going to stick around for the long haul.It may also depend on the outcome of the next point…2. We did not see a clear distinction between blockchain, tokens and cryptocurrenciesNo one in particular is to blame for this, but the fact remains: 99.9 percent of people outside the technical crypto/blockchain community associate blockchain with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Period. Unfortunately, this is enough to block adoption by many.If anything, the huge ICO numbers that 2017 produced only reinforced this association as headlines around the world flashed dollar amounts with each new token sale.The problem with this is that, to the wider world, it inherently reduces crypto to \"a new way to make money through fundraising and speculation.\" This is, and will continue to be, a major handicap going forward.I personally applaud voices such as that of William Mougayar and guests of his Token Summit series, who add more perspective to the discussion and differentiate the various levels of technology and token models.For blockchain to reach its true potential, these distinctions will need to be made and explained.3. We have not yet seen self-regulation take holdWith major attention focused on the SEC, FCA and Swiss FINMA, regulation has never been far from the crypto conversation over the last year.And in the face of expected scrutiny, numerous self-regulation initiatives have been formed with the Crypto Valley Association announcing a Code of Conduct and Waves setting up a foundation for ICO standards, among others.So far, however, these initiatives haven\\'t produced much, with the afore-mentioned Code of Conduct still unpublished.In some ways, this can\\'t be surprising since it isn\\'t hard to imagine \"self-regulation\" as a clever tool to, on the one hand, keep governmental watchdogs at bay, while promoting a \"higher standard\" which can be used for financial gain.The coming year may, indeed, bring more visible results on this front – and it should – before scam projects over-multiply and influential advisors over-abuse their positions to artificially pump projects of little-to-no value, compelling governmental regulators to take over in full force.4. We do not have inter-chain operability.Finally, in a more technical note, inter-chain operability remains (for now) an elusive holy grail.The past year saw serious efforts to tackle it. Polkadot grabbed most of the attention (and its creator as well, for different reasons) and Cosmos not far behind. They\\'re not the only ones, though, with quieter projects like Block Collider working with unique angles on the same problem.Maybe it seems unreasonable to expect inter-chain connections to come along so soon, even as blockchain and crypto continue to in their relative infancy. But if there is one thing that 2017 didn’t give us, one gaping hole that 2018 can fill, this is it.But what about the big successes?\\xa0CoinDesk is still accepting submissions for its 2017 in Review.

Notably listed in the filing are a number of competing companies, among them some of the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase\\'s GDAX offering and Bitstamp.Looking further, the venture foresees that it will even offer customer cryptocurrencies to clients. In the short-term, however, it intends to focus on a publishing business. Bitzumi has an affiliate deal with investment newsletter service Agora Financial, LLC to \"market and sell\" a newsletter created by Altucher.According to the filing, Scot Cohen, an oil and gas industry entrepreneur, will serve as CEO, while David Briones and Glenn Pollack will take the roles of CFO and director, respectively. The firm has registered as a money services business in 50 states, FinCEN indicates.For more on Altucher\\'s outlook on bitcoin, view our most recent interview here.Disclosure:\\xa0CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.Correction:\\xa0This article has been updated with comments from Altucher received after publication.Portrait photo\\xa0via James Altucher\\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

       "  'content': \"Bitcoin is gaining altitude today, amid a sharp drop in prices of some alternative currencies.Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index jumped 7 percent to an intraday high of $16,181 in the last two hours. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 10 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token has depreciated by 9 percent in the last 24 hours, having soared to new heights on Jan. 3.Other alternative currencies like NEM (XEM), Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (STR) are down at least 12 percent each. More importantly, the\\xa0XRP/BTC (ripple-bitcoin) pair has taken a beating in the last couple of hours.\\xa0XEM/BTC, ADA/BTC, ETH/BTC (ethereum-bitcoin) and LTC/BTC (litecoin-bitcoin) are also losing altitude. So, bitcoin (BTC) seems to have caught a bid wave at $14,848.10 (07:29 UTC), tracking the weakness in the cross cryptocurrency pairs (ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, XRP/BTC) – that is, money made from the altcoin rally is likely being channeled back into BTC.Price chart analysis also suggests BTC could extend the rally to $18,000-$18,600 in the short-run.4-hour chartThe above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:\\nAn inverse head and shoulder breakout. As of writing, BTC is trading well above the neckline hurdle of $15,550, so the bullish breakout is pretty much a done deal. Prices could rise to $18,600 (target as per the measured height method) over the weekend.\\nOther factors – including a breach of the falling trendline, a bullish break of the falling wedge, higher lows as represented by the rising trendline – also favor further upside in BTC.\\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and rising, indicating scope for a rally in prices.\\nView\\nBTC could cut through resistance at $16,490 and move towards $18,000–18,600 mark over the weekend.\\nBearish scenario: A failure to hold above the neckline support (former resistance) of $15,500 followed by a break below $14,230 today would open the doors for a drop to sub-$12,500 levels.\\nDog race image via Shutterstock\\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
